# Insecurity
A role playing 2D game that my team worked on for the Technology Student Association (TSA) club.

The player starts out as a neutral looking character and based on his decisions in the game, he turns more and more evil or good with his character sprite reflecting his inner nature.

The character suffers from insecurity about his prosthetic leg, which leads to bullying during school. Ultimately, it is up to him to decide how to react to the situations that he faces in order to establish friendly relations with the bully.
